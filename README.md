This project is done as part of our course named Database Management. Here we used Django framework to build the site which has the following features: It searches throughout the database for both tags and Description of the video which matches for the given key word. Then this returns the top 5 results and will be displayed in a pannel. Then by selecting a video from the list of videos from given pannel it opens up the statistics of the video using data from MongoDb database. Then in the side pannel videos related to selected video will be displayed using edge weights data which we obtain from neo4j database. Our site has also some features like storing all the query and videos selected by the current user and can be displayed by selecting respective button. It also has Feeling lucky option (Copied from google :P) which displays some videos you might be interested if you have nothing to watch.

I hope this gives an idea about my site. Suggestions welcomed.
